# Python
This code redirects to a voting site. 
Basically it opens the chrome browser , finds the person to vote using its ID. Votes for the person. Closes Chrome.
You need to have chrome webdriver on your machine.
Install the Python modules in advance.
This site doesn't require any log in process. 
A person caan vote any number of times.
I haven't used it to vote for anyone just for educational purposes and to get hand on python.'
